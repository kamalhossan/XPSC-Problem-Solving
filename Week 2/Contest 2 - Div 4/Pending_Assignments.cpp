// Chef has finally decided to complete all of his pending assignments.

// There are 
// X
// X assignments where each assignment takes 
// Y
// Y minutes to complete.
// Find whether Chef would be able to complete all the assignments in 
// Z
// Z days.

// Input Format
// The first line of input will contain a single integer 
// T
// T, denoting the number of test cases.
// Each test case consists three space-separated integers 
// X
// ,
// Y
// ,
// X,Y, and 
// Z
// Z â€” the number of assignments, time taken in minutes to complete each assignment, and the number of days in which Chef wants to complete the assignments.
// Output Format
// For each test case, output on a new line, YES, if Chef would be able to complete all the assignments in 
// Z
// Z days. Otherwise, print NO.

// You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings YES, yEs, yes, and yeS will all be treated as identical).
